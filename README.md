* Redux

  * Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.     Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

* Redux Toolkit

  * Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. ... It also includes the most widely used Redux addons, like Redux Thunk for async logic and Reselect for writing selector functions, so that you can use them right away.
